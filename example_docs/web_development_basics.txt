Web Development Fundamentals

Introduction to Web Development

Web development involves creating websites and web applications that run in browsers. Modern web development encompasses both frontend (what users see) and backend (server-side logic) development.

Core Technologies

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of web pages. It provides the structure and content of a webpage. HTML uses tags to define elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and forms.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) controls the visual presentation and layout of HTML elements. With CSS, you can set colors, fonts, spacing, positioning, and create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.

JavaScript is the programming language of the web. It enables interactivity, dynamic content updates, and can run both in the browser (client-side) and on servers (Node.js).

Modern Web Development

Frontend Frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular simplify building complex user interfaces. These frameworks use component-based architectures, making code reusable and maintainable.

Backend Development involves server-side programming. Common technologies include Node.js, Python (Django, Flask), Ruby on Rails, and Java (Spring Boot). Backends handle database operations, API creation, and business logic.

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow different applications to communicate. REST APIs use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources. GraphQL is an alternative that allows clients to request exactly the data they need.

Databases store application data. SQL databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL use structured tables, while NoSQL databases like MongoDB store data in flexible document formats.

Version Control with Git allows developers to track changes, collaborate, and manage code versions. GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket host repositories and facilitate team collaboration.

Deployment and DevOps

Modern web applications are deployed to cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. Containerization with Docker packages applications with dependencies, while Kubernetes orchestrates containers at scale.

CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines automate testing and deployment. Tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and GitLab CI help maintain code quality and enable rapid releases.

Web Performance

Optimizing web performance is crucial for user experience. Techniques include code minification, image compression, lazy loading, and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). Performance metrics like Core Web Vitals measure loading speed, interactivity, and visual stability.

Security is paramount in web development. Best practices include HTTPS encryption, input validation, authentication and authorization, and protection against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS attacks.
